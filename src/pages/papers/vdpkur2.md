The objective of this paper is to establish that algorithms, which reconstruct the coupling between solar proxies based on the properties of the Kuramoto equations, and algorithms, based on the van der Pol equations, might produce similar estimates. To this end, the inverse problem is formulated as follows: reconstruct the coupling based on the solutions of the corresponding equations. For either system of the equations we construct an algorithm solving the inverse problem and establish that there exists a range of moderate values of the correlation such that the algorithms produce practically identical coupling within the established range. The lower boundary of this range is dependent on the half-difference of the oscillatorsâ€™ frequencies. Then, we apply the two reconstruction algorithms to solar index ISSN and the geomagnetic index aa, which are proxies to the toroidal and poloidal magnetic fields of the Sun respectively. Their correlation belongs within the range that yields the proximity of the coupling reconstructed with all solar cycles from 11 till 23 except 20 and, possibly, 21. Our finding relate the reconstruction of characteristics of solar activity inferred by Blanter et al [Sol. Phys. 2014, 289, 4309; Sol. Phys. 2016, 291, 1003] from the Kuramoto model to the state of the art solar dynamo theory based on the magnetohydrodynamic equations.
