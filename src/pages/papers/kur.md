<small>Recent advances in the applications of the Kuramoto model to a wide range of real-life processes require the reconstruction of processesâ€™ parameters from observations. This paper explores the inverse problem for the Kuramoto model of two nonlinear oscillators with slowly varying coupling in the form of a single-step function, sine-wave, and auto-regressive process with a view to deriving the basic properties of the reconstruction procedure, that is the connection of the reconstruction efficiency with the coupling strength and estimates of the time it takes for a system to phase-lock. By investigating the de-synchronization of the solar faculae series, which represent signals coming from the northern and southern solar hemispheres, we relate the de-synchronization of the series, which occurred in the early 1960s to the changes in the coupling of the underlying real oscillators.</small>
